# Data

## `Case study data_10-30-23.csv`

These were the data that 2 students collected together in their first semester in this research course. This data sheet was downloaded from the Google Sheet where they were recording their findings. Both students completed Modules 1-3, and had worked through some part of Module 4.

# Teaching notes

- This was taught as a live coding session. I demonstrated how to create all the bar graphs in this tutorial, then worked with each student individually to personalize their figures.
- I like to run the code for the complex bar graph one line at a time so students can see how it builds on itself, and as a demonstration of how students can troubleshoot their own code.
