# Data



# Teaching notes

- I had students add the data for their counties to a shared Google sheet so that students could compare their counties with others. You may wish to record data in a different way. If you do, you will want to find and replace mentions of the shared Google sheet throughout these modules.
- I had students email me their finished PDFs. If you have a different way of collecting assignments, you will want to change the instructions at the end of the module to reflect that.
